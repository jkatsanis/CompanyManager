== `MyHashSet` class

* Here you'll just implement a generic HashSet.

== `Model` class

* Enum of ProductTypes, and enum of Position of an employee

== `Initializer` class

* Here are Companys initialized. Employees are randomly hired at companies, products are random initialized aswell. 

== `Employe` class

* In this class you can Demote an employee. If an employee with Position.Employee is demoted he will get fired! Owner can not be Promoted.
* Contains a ToString() method, printing the name and the position

== `Company` class

* Manages the employees and the products

* You are able to view the whole organisation. This will print all the employees and products with the .ToString() method to the console.

* You can select a product from the list. Only a valid number can be entered.

* You can send products to other companies

* You can select which company you want to manage.
